# Exercise 1
All of these exercises are using Deno for javasript execution. In this exercise we are doing some very basic programming things.




## Task 1

Make a javascript console program that prints "Hello daddy" to console.

Example output of the program
```
Hello daddy
```

## Task 2

Make a javascript console program that assigns expression value 5 + 5 to variable named value. Variable type should be const. After assigment print value to console.

Example output of the program
```
10
```


## Task 3

Make a javascript console program that assigns value 4 to variable named a and value 5 to variable named b. After this make third variable named c and assign sum of the a and b to that variable. In the end print variable c to console.

All variables should be const type.

Example output of the program
```
9
```

## Task 4

Make a javascript console program that has two variables of any name. First variable contains value "Hello" and second variable contains value "world". After this make third variable named message and concat two strings to that. 

All variables should be const type.

When you print this message variable to console i should show following:
```
Hello world
```



## Task 5

This is first task to contain if statements you can learn more about this from:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else

Make a javascript console program that has two number variables a and b and assign number values to these. After these assigments make if else statement that check if variable a is larger than variable b 
if it is then program should print text "Variable a is larger" and otherwise it should print Variables are either same value or b is larger.


## Task 6

Usually in programming languages remainder is calculated using % character for example:
```js
console.log(12 % 5);
// expected output: 2
```

Make a javascript console program that first assignes number to variable and then if the number
is even prints text "Number is even" and if the number is not even does nothing.

## Task 7

Make a javascript console program that first assignes number to variable and then if the number is smaller than
5 it prints "Its smaller than five" but if the number is smaller than 10 its only printing "Its smaller than 10"
Otherwise the program is printing "Its too big". In the end program prints text "Done".


## Task 8

Make a javascript console program that first assigns some text to variable and then if text in that variable
equals "meat" then you print text "Cat likes meat"

## Task 9

This is first exercise to use for loop you can learn more about this from:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration

Make a javascript program that prints numbers 1 - 10 using for loop.

## Task 10

Make a javascript program that assigns number to variable and then prints word "cow"
as many times that variables value is;

## Task 11

Make a javascript program that counts from 10 to zero and prints the numbers.

## Task 12

Make a javascript program that prints all the variables that are divisible by 2 between
0 - 30 using for loop.

## Task 13

This is first exercise to use while loop you can learn more about while loops from:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while

Mak a javascript program that assigns number 50 to variable and then using while loop divides 
the variable until its smaller than 1. In the end print the variables value.

## Task 14

This is first exercise to use functions you can learn more about functions from:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions

Example function
```js
function square(number) {
  return number * number;
}
```

Make a javascript function named hello which prints text "Hello cow" and then call this in your program

## Task 15

Make a javascript function named hello which has one parameter named name. When you call this function
it should print to console "Hello ${name parameter value}"

## Task 16

Make a javascript function names calculateRectangleArea that has two parameters width and height. 
This function calculates the area of the rectange and then returns that.

```javascript
console.log(calculateRectangleArea(5, 5))
// Expected output 25
```

## Task 17

This is first exercise to use arrays you can learn more about them from:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array

Make a javascript program that first assigns three numbers to array and then using loop 
calculates sum of these values.
